<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, this is me Rainul! A high school junior with lots of motivation to learn, learn something new, make something
   innovative! I was curious about literally everything from my childhood and this curiosity brought me more closer to
   science. To be very honest, I love Science and the way this Universe works!!
