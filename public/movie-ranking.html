<h2> My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr>
<h3> INTERSTALLER</h3>
<pr> this movie shows the time zone theory, beautiful concepts like WORMHOLE and all. Perfect GOATED movie for a sci-fi genre</pr>
<h3> Big Hero 6</h3>
<pr> this is the animation movie i enjoyed as a kid and this is the one i remember now</pr>
<h3> Inception</h3>
<pr> again, as i love sci-fi movies, this has to be one of those which i love. Amazing concepts, you'll be needing to brainstorm to understand whats going on and all</pr>
